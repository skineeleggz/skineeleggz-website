Sights & Sounds is a new series on my YouTube channel that combines video footage from my Spokes, Jokes & Anecdotes series with relaxing music from some of my favorite artists. The hope is to have the viewer sit back & relax, enjoy a few minutes of visually stimulating sights & relaxing sounds.

In this first episode, I'd like to thank DeeSaxx for letting me use his amazing edit of VER:WEST - 5 Seconds Before Sunrise. Check out his music!
