This episode is a special one!

My uncle (Joe Da Silva) created synth music back in the 80s/90s that I've always been a fan of. I've always been curious how his songs would sound if done in a Trance style. I contacted my friend SoundLift to see if he could remix a couple of my uncle's songs. (If you haven't heard of SoundLift, please do yourself a favor and click the links below to listen to some really beautiful music.)

I'd like to thank SoundLift for remixing my uncle's song called "Summer Time". 

Check out his music!
