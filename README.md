# SkineeLeggz

This repo is public to help anyone starting off with Nuxt.js. You can see exactly how the code is currently working to generate the SkineeLeggz website at https://skineeleggz.com

## Important Steps

1. Installed `@nuxtjs/style-resources` which will help avoid having to import SASS variables, mixins, etc all the time.
- Followed instructions at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuxtjs/style-resources
- Once complete, should see `node-sass`, `sass-loader` and `@nuxtjs/style-resources` in `package.json`
- Also now have the benefit of being able to write SASS code within the `<style>` tags

Add something about Analytics and vue-gtag

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
